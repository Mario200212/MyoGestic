MyoGestic Model Definitions
==============================

We support two types of models: `Catboost <https://catboost.ai/>`_ and `Sklearn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_.

.. tip:: Each definitions contains a save, load, and train method.  If you want to use your own model you need to provide these methods as well. See :ref:`examples-index` for add your own model.

The model definitions are as follows:
